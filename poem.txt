Whispers of the Wild

Beneath the sky so vast and wide,
The forest breathes, the rivers glide.
A symphony of wind and leaves,
A peace that only Earth achieves.

The mountains rise with ancient grace,
Their snow-capped peaks time can’t erase.
While valleys cradle fields of green,
A canvas vast, serene, unseen.

The ocean hums a ceaseless song,
Where waves and tides belong, belong.
Its depths conceal a secret world,
Of coral blooms and treasures pearled.

The sun sets fire to evening skies,
As twilight paints where daylight dies.
The stars emerge, a silver choir,
To light the dark with whispered fire.

Oh, nature's heart beats strong and free,
In every stone, in every tree.
A fleeting gift we must defend,
Her wild beauty—our truest friend.
